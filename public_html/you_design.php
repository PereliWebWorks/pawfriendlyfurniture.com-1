			<ul class="col-xs-12 comfy-list">
				<li>Offering Customers the ability to design a cat tree to their cat's specific needs by choosing the different <a href="#bed-options">bed styles</a>: 18" flat bed, 24" sturdily constructed scoop bed, 24" round bed with rim, or tunnel with diamond hole. Scroll down to see pictures of the different styles of beds that you may choose for each level.</li>
				<li>
					Our trees are built by levels, with one bed per level.
					<ul>
						<li>Three levels: Height is approximately 4 feet</li>
						<li>Four levels: Height is approximately 5 feet</li>
						<li>Five levels: Height is approximately 6 feet</li>
						<li>Six levels: Height is approximately 7 feet</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Choose how many levels you would like on your tree by choosing your bed styles for each level. The base of the tree is not to be counted as a level. Levels are counted by how many beds you want on the tree. After you choose your levels and bed styles simply contact us to finalize your order, or to answer any questions.
				</li>
				<li>We offer staple-free furniture as an upcharge. We use non-toxic hot glue to attach the carpet versus our industrial strength staples.</li>
				<li>Carpet choices are neutral colors only! We have beige, tan, browns and a speckled neutral colored carpet. We shop more based on the quality of the carpet than the color. Please call to see what carpet we have available when ordering. Customers may purchase their own (colored) carpet separately.</li>
				<li>We require a 25% down payment on orders.â€‹</li>
				<li>Extra sisal rope is an upcharge of $15.00. All trees do come with some sisal rope included.</li>
				<li>We ask for up to 2 weeks to complete your tree.</li>
				<li>We offer delivery for free within 15 miles from Cross Plains. Otherwise, pick up is arranged at our house after 5:00 pm or on weekends (by appointment only).</li>
				<li>Unforunately we <b>do not</b> ship our products due to the high shipping costs.</li>
				<li>Payments can be made by Cash, Credit Card, or PayPal.</li>
